# Vartex — Phase 1 (Foundation)

"Create. Connect. Grow. Earn." — a privacy-first social platform.

This is **Phase 1 only**, from the roadmap: authentication, database, Row Level
Security, and profiles. Everything else (feed, communities, polls, YouTube
discovery, Earn Center, ads, demo mode, E2E messaging...) ships in later
phases on top of this base — building all of it at once produces something
untestable and unmaintainable, so it's being built in the order the spec
itself lays out under "Development Phases."

## What's here

- `index.html` — single-file frontend: landing hero, signup/login/logout, profile view + edit
- `supabase/schema.sql` — `profiles` table, auto-create-on-signup trigger, RLS policies

## Setup

1. **Create a Supabase project** at supabase.com.
2. **Run the schema**: open the SQL editor in your Supabase dashboard, paste
   the contents of `supabase/schema.sql`, and run it. This creates the
   `profiles` table, a trigger that auto-creates a profile row (with a
   channel name and referral code) whenever someone signs up, and RLS
   policies so:
   - anyone can read active profiles (they're public by design)
   - a user can only update their own row
   - no client can insert a profile row directly — only the trigger can
3. **Get your keys**: Project Settings → API. You need the **Project URL**
   and the **anon public key**.
4. **Wire up the frontend**: open `index.html` and replace:
   ```js
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
   ```
   The anon key is safe to expose in frontend code — Row Level Security is
   what actually controls access, not key secrecy. **Never** put your
   service-role key in this file or in any frontend code, ever.
5. **Email confirmation**: by default Supabase requires email confirmation
   before a session is issued. You can turn this off for local testing under
   Authentication → Settings → "Confirm email", but leave it on for
   production.

## Deploy

No build step — push this folder to a GitHub repo and connect it to
Cloudflare Pages as a static site (build command: none, output directory:
`/`). Done.

## Phase 2 (now included)

Run `supabase/schema_phase2.sql` **after** `schema.sql`, in the same SQL
editor. It adds:

- `posts`, `follows`, `likes`, `comments` tables
- triggers that keep `likes_count`/`comments_count` on posts and
  `channel_followers_count`/`channel_posts_count` on profiles in sync
  automatically — the frontend never hand-updates these counters
- RLS policies: posts/follows/likes/comments are publicly readable; a user
  can only create/delete rows where they are the actor (author, follower, or
  liker)

The frontend (`index.html`) now has a logged-in app shell with three tabs:

- **Home** — composer + feed of all active posts, with like/unlike,
  expandable comments, and a follow/unfollow button on other people's posts
- **Search** — debounced search across people (username/display name) and
  post content
- **Profile** — unchanged from Phase 1 (channel name, bio, referral code)

## Phase 3 (now included)

Run `supabase/schema_phase3.sql` **after** `schema.sql` and
`schema_phase2.sql`. It adds:

- `communities`, `community_members` — plus `posts.community_id` (nullable)
  so any post can optionally belong to a community
- `polls`, `poll_options`, `poll_votes` — one vote per user per poll,
  enforced by a primary key, with a trigger keeping `votes_count` in sync
- `notifications` — written only by security-definer trigger functions
  (follow, like, comment) so the client can never forge one; the recipient
  can read and mark their own as read, nothing else

New in the frontend:

- **Communities tab** — create a community, browse/join others, open one to
  see its own feed
- **Composer** — a "Post to" dropdown (your feed or any community you've
  joined) and a poll toggle (question + 2–4 options)
- **Alerts tab** — follows/likes/comments notifications, with an unread dot
  on the tab; opening the tab marks them read
- Polls appear inline in the Home feed (and inside a community's feed);
  tapping an option votes once and reveals live percentages

## Phase 4 (now included)

Run `supabase/schema_phase4.sql` **after** phases 1–3. It's a single file
that both creates the demo tables and seeds them — safe to re-run (it
clears prior demo rows first). It creates:

- `demo_accounts`, `demo_posts`, `demo_comments`, `demo_communities` — kept
  completely separate from the real `profiles`/`posts`/`communities`
  tables, per spec §38–41. Demo rows are never linked to `auth.users`, so
  they can never log in or be mistaken for real accounts.
- RLS: public read-only on all four tables. No insert/update/delete policy
  exists for any client role, so only the seed script itself (running with
  owner privileges in the SQL editor) can write to them.
- ~1,000 demo personas across the spec's category list (Technology, AI,
  Business, Maharashtra, Agriculture, Creator Economy, etc.), 1–3 sample
  posts each, a canned comment on ~40% of posts, and ~24 demo communities.
- Every generated bio and post is template-based and explicitly labeled
  "DEMO" / "AI DEMO" / "SAMPLE" — never framed as real news or attributed
  to a real person, per spec §12.

The landing page now shows a live **"Explore the platform — DEMO"** section
(visible to anyone, no login needed) with sample creators, a sample feed,
and sample communities, each card carrying a visible DEMO badge — so a
first-time visitor sees the platform "alive" per spec §57, instead of an
empty page.

## Phase 5 (now included)

YouTube discovery — channel/video search using the official YouTube Data
API v3, official embeds only. Per spec §14: no downloading, no re-hosting,
no scraping of any other social platform.

**Why an Edge Function**: the YouTube API key must never reach the browser
— a client-exposed key can be extracted and abused against your quota
within minutes. So the search call goes through a small server-side proxy:

```
Browser → sb.functions.invoke('youtube-search') → Edge Function (holds the key) → YouTube Data API
```

New file: `supabase/functions/youtube-search/index.ts`

### Setup

1. **Get a YouTube Data API key**: Google Cloud Console → enable "YouTube
   Data API v3" → Credentials → Create API key. Restrict it to that API.
2. **Install the Supabase CLI** if you don't have it: `npm install -g supabase`
3. **Link and deploy**:
   ```
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
   supabase functions deploy youtube-search
   supabase secrets set YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
   Your project ref is the subdomain in your Supabase URL
   (`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`).
4. That's it — the frontend already calls it via `sb.functions.invoke(...)`,
   which uses your existing anon key for auth automatically.

### What it does in the app

A new **YouTube tab**: search videos or channels, thumbnails link out to
the real YouTube page, and tapping a video thumbnail plays it inline using
YouTube's own `<iframe>` embed — never a downloaded file.

### Graceful fallback

If `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` isn't set yet, or the YouTube API errors out (quota,
bad key, etc.), the function returns a clean empty result instead of
crashing, and the tab shows "YouTube discovery isn't available right now"
rather than a broken screen — per spec §45/§55.

## Phase 6 (now included)

Earn Center, referral system, and a demo advertising marketplace. Run
`supabase/schema_phase6.sql` **after** phases 1–4.

- **`platform_settings`** — revenue-share and eligibility numbers
  (`REFERRAL_REWARD_RATE_INR`, `MINIMUM_CREATOR_FOLLOWERS`, etc.) live in
  the database, publicly readable but never writable by the client — per
  spec §20, these are never hard-coded in frontend JS.
- **Referrals are now functional**: signup has an optional referral-code
  field; when a referred user makes their first post, a trigger marks the
  referral "qualified" and credits the referrer a *pending* earning event
  at the configured rate — no fake instant payouts.
- **`earning_events`** — a real ledger, trigger-only writes, readable only
  by its owner. The Earn tab shows total/pending/available plus the full
  event list.
- **Demo ad marketplace**: any user can register as an advertiser and
  launch a campaign (headline, body, target URL, demo budget) for the
  `HOME_FEED_TOP` slot. One active campaign shows at the top of the Home
  feed, clearly marked **Sponsored**, with "Why am I seeing this?", Hide,
  and Report controls per spec §48. Impressions/clicks are logged to
  `ad_events` and rolled up into each campaign's counters automatically.
- **Creator eligibility**: the Earn tab checks the logged-in user's
  followers/posts against the configured minimums and shows a clear ✓ or
  a gap — transparent, not a black box.

This is illustrative infrastructure — no real payment processor or ad
network (Google Ad Manager, etc.) is connected. That's future work once
the platform is ready for it, per spec §16.

## Phase 7 (now included)

Privacy Center, E2E messaging, and moderation. Run
`supabase/schema_phase7.sql` **after** phases 1–4 and 6.

- **Privacy Center** — a real page (footer link, or from Messages) with
  plain-language sections on what's public, what's encrypted, what's not
  stored, and what we don't claim ("legally certified," "100% anonymous" —
  never, per spec §30).
- **E2E messaging is functional**: each user gets an RSA-OAEP keypair
  generated in the browser on first visit to Messages. Sending a message
  generates a fresh AES-GCM key, encrypts the text with it, then wraps that
  AES key twice with RSA (once for the recipient, once for the sender) so
  both sides can read the conversation later. The server (`messages_metadata`)
  only ever stores ciphertext.
  - **Honest limitation, stated plainly in the Privacy Center**: the
    private key lives in browser `localStorage`, not on the server. Switch
    devices or clear browser data without exporting your key first, and
    old messages become unreadable — there's no backend recovery, because
    that's what "the server never sees plaintext" actually means.
- **Moderation**: Report (with a reason) and Block buttons on every post.
  Blocking removes that person's posts/polls from your feed and is checked
  via RLS-backed tables (`blocks`, `reports`). There's no full admin review
  queue yet — reports are visible via the Supabase dashboard for now.
- **Your Data** (Profile tab): download a JSON export of your profile,
  posts, and comments, or delete your public content outright. Full
  account deletion (removing the `auth.users` row) needs a service-role
  call this frontend intentionally doesn't make — that's flagged as a
  "contact support" step rather than faked.

## Phase 8 (now included — final phase)

Responsive, performance, and accessibility polish. No database changes —
`index.html` only.

- **Accessibility**: a skip-to-content link, `role="tablist"`/`aria-selected`
  on the main tabs, `aria-label`s on icon-only buttons (like, comment,
  report, block), `aria-live` regions on inline success/error messages,
  visible focus outlines (`:focus-visible`), and `prefers-reduced-motion`
  is respected (skeleton shimmer and smooth-scroll both turn off).
- **Mobile**: a fixed bottom navigation bar (Home / Groups / Search / Chat
  / Profile) appears under 640px, matching the spec's mobile-first bottom
  nav — the full tab bar remains as a horizontally-scrollable strip above
  it for the tabs that don't fit.
- **Performance**: the Home feed now paginates posts 15 at a time with a
  "Load more" button instead of fetching 30 posts on every load — per spec
  §37 ("do not load 1,000 demo profiles at once, paginate them"), applied
  here to the real feed too.
- Added `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="theme-color">`, and a
  `preconnect` hint to the Supabase project domain for a faster first
  request.

## Phase 9 — fixes + remaining quick wins (this round)

You asked specifically why message notifications weren't arriving, plus to
finish whatever's left, fastest-impact first. Priority order used, and why:

1. **Message notifications (the reported bug)** — a trigger on
   `messages_metadata` now inserts a `'message'`-type notification for the
   recipient the moment a message is sent. The Alerts tab's unread dot also
   now polls every 25 seconds while you're logged in, so you don't have to
   sit on the Alerts tab to notice — highest priority since it was reported
   as broken.
2. **Save/bookmark posts** — quick, high-visible-value, was in the original
   spec's post actions list. Tap 🔖 on any post; find them later under
   Profile → "Saved Posts".
3. **Demo polls** — the original spec's demo ecosystem included sample
   polls with sample responses; these were missing. ~10 illustrative polls
   now show on the landing page's demo section (static results, not
   interactive — they're DEMO content).
4. **Latest / Trending sort** on the Home feed — a fast, self-contained
   addition (`ORDER BY likes_count` vs `created_at`) that covers part of
   the spec's "Explore → Trending" idea without a bigger rebuild.

Run `supabase/schema_phase9.sql` after phases 1–4, 6, 7. Only `index.html`
changed besides that.

### Deliberately deferred (bigger, lower-ratio-of-value-to-time)

- **Admin review dashboard** — needs a role system (admin flag + RLS
  changes across nearly every table) before it can be built safely. Real
  scope, not a quick add.
- **Full multilingual UI (English/Marathi/Hindi)** — `profiles.language`
  already exists as a column, but translating every UI string and wiring a
  language switcher is a large, mostly-mechanical effort better done as its
  own focused pass rather than squeezed in.
- **Creator Studio analytics (views-over-time charts)** — needs a
  page-view event log that doesn't exist yet; the current channel view
  count is a simple counter, not a time series.
- **Real ad-network / payment integration** — explicitly future work per
  the original spec (§16); nothing to build client-side today.

Say the word on any of these and it's next.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Auth: signup/login/logout/reset | ✅ (reset via Supabase's built-in flow) |
| Social: profile/follow/post/like/comment/save/share | ✅ except "save" (bookmarking) — not built |
| Discovery: search/explore/trending/topics/YouTube | ✅ search + YouTube; no separate trending/topics view |
| Communities: create/join/post/moderate | ✅ create/join/post; no per-community moderator tools yet |
| Creator: channel/analytics/earnings | ✅ channel + Earn Center; no full Creator Studio analytics tabs |
| Monetization: Earn Center/demo revenue/referral/ad slots/eligibility | ✅ |
| Privacy: Privacy Center/data settings/deletion/E2E | ✅ |
| Demo: 1,000 accounts/posts/communities/polls | ✅ accounts+posts+communities; demo polls not seeded |
| Security: RLS/no service-role key/validation/report-block | ✅ |
| Deployment: GitHub + static hosting + mobile responsive | ✅ |

Not built, honestly: admin review dashboard, full multilingual UI (EN/MR/HI
throughout), advertiser payment integration, bookmarking/"save", and a
dedicated Creator Studio analytics view — these are natural next steps
beyond the original 8-phase roadmap.

## Phase 10 — the four remaining big items, now closed out

### 1. Admin dashboard ✅
Run `schema_phase10.sql`, then bootstrap your first admin (nobody gets this
from signup — it's a manual, deliberate step):
```sql
update public.profiles set is_admin = true where username = 'yourusername';
```
Log back in — an **Admin** tab appears (hidden for everyone else): platform
metrics (users/posts/communities/open reports) and a moderation queue
pulling from every filed report. Dismiss or Remove content directly —
removing sets the post/comment/community to REMOVED or suspends a
reported user.

### 2. Marathi + Hindi UI ✅ (primary chrome — not literally every string)
A language switcher (EN / मराठी / हिंदी) sits in the top-right header,
works logged in or out, and persists (localStorage, plus `profiles.language`
for logged-in users). It covers navigation, the landing page, auth forms,
and the most common actions.

**Honest scope**: this translates interface chrome, not user-generated
content (that's what people type) and not every secondary string (error
toasts, less-common labels). Full 100% coverage of every string across all
10 phases would be its own dedicated pass; this covers what a first-time
Marathi/Hindi speaker sees immediately.

### 3. Real ad payments (Razorpay) ✅ scaffolding — needs your own keys
Two new Edge Functions: `create-razorpay-order` (creates the order, pins
the amount server-side) and `verify-razorpay-payment` (checks Razorpay's
HMAC signature server-side before crediting the campaign — this is what
makes it a real payment rather than something the browser could fake). In
the Earn tab, each campaign now has a **"Fund with Razorpay"** button that
opens real Razorpay Checkout.

**This one genuinely needs your own account** — it can't be completed
without your business's Razorpay credentials:
1. Sign up at razorpay.com (test mode needs no KYC and works immediately
   with test cards; live payments need business KYC)
2. Get your Key ID + Key Secret from Settings → API Keys
3. Deploy both functions the same way as `youtube-search` (via the
   dashboard editor)
4. Set secrets: `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` — Supabase already
   provides `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to every Edge
   Function automatically, no need to set those yourself

### 4. Creator Studio analytics chart ✅
The Earn tab now draws a 14-day engagement bar chart (likes + comments
received on your posts, per day) using a plain `<canvas>` — no chart
library needed. It's real data, computed client-side from your actual
`likes` and `comments` tables.

All 10 phases are now built. What's left is real business setup (your own
Razorpay account, an admin username to promote) rather than more code.

## Phase 12 — responsive layout, images, Explore, onboarding

No new database changes — `index.html` only.

- **Responsive across devices**: at ≥1100px width (laptop/desktop) the Home
  feed now shows a two-column layout with a sticky right rail (Trending
  now, Suggested creators) — desktop screen space was sitting unused
  before. At ≥900px (tablet/iPad) content gets a bit more breathing room.
  Below that it's still the single-column, bottom-nav mobile layout from
  Phase 8. No layout is hidden or broken on any of these — it's the same
  HTML, just reflowed by CSS grid at different breakpoints.
- **Image posts (Cloudinary, unsigned upload)** — the composer has an
  image button now; pick a photo, it uploads straight to Cloudinary from
  the browser (no backend needed — that's what an *unsigned* upload preset
  is for) and shows inline in the feed. **Action needed**: replace
  `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` near the top of
  the `<script>` in `index.html` with your own — sign up at cloudinary.com
  (free tier is generous), then Settings → Upload → Add an **unsigned**
  upload preset.
- **Explore tab** — Popular Creators, New Creators, Trending Posts, Browse
  Communities, all from real data (follower counts, signup dates, likes,
  member counts) — the "Explore" section from the original spec that was
  previously folded into Search only.
- **Onboarding** — after signup, a 3-step flow: pick interests (saved to
  your profile), follow a few suggested creators, join a community. It's
  skippable at any point.

## Phase 13 — the last seven items

Run `supabase/schema_phase12.sql` after phases 1–4, 6, 7, 10, 11. Deploy
the new `ai-assist` Edge Function the same way as the others.

1. **Video & link posts** — composer now has 🎬 (paste a video URL — YouTube
   links embed properly, direct `.mp4` links play in a native player) and
   🔗 (paste any link — renders as a card). No upload pipeline for video
   files themselves; that's a bigger addition (large file handling, storage
   costs) — URL-based covers the common case fast.
2. **Creator Studio tabs** — new **Studio** tab: Overview (stats + badges)
   and Posts (manage/delete your posts, appeal a removed one). Analytics
   and Monetization stay in the Earn tab rather than being duplicated.
3. **Gamification** — five starter badges (First Post, Rising Creator, Top
   Creator, Prolific Poster, Community Builder) computed live from your
   real stats, shown in Studio → Overview. Add more rules in `BADGE_RULES`
   in `index.html` whenever you want.
4. **AI features** — a ✨ **Improve** button in the composer rewrites your
   draft via Claude (through the new `ai-assist` Edge Function). **Needs
   your own Anthropic API key** from console.anthropic.com — separate from
   any Claude.ai subscription, this is a paid API account. Set the
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret the same way as the other functions.
5. **Mute** — a 🔕 button next to Report/Block on every post. Unlike Block,
   muting is silent and one-directional: they're hidden from your feed but
   can still message/follow you normally, and they're never told.
6. **Appeal workflow** — a removed post shows "Appeal removal" in Studio →
   Posts; a suspended account shows an appeal button right on the Profile
   tab. Admin tab has a new **Appeals** queue to approve (restores the
   content/account) or deny.
7. **Admin settings UI** — the Admin tab can now edit `platform_settings`
   (referral rate, eligibility thresholds, etc.) and add/remove
   `banned_terms` directly — no more SQL editor required for day-to-day
   moderation tuning.

## What's still genuinely not built
A real video-file upload pipeline (vs. URL-based), Brand Opportunities
matching, and a fully separate Analytics sub-tab in Studio (it currently
points to the existing Earn tab chart instead of duplicating it).

## Phase 14 — launch-readiness essentials

- **Forgot password** — a working link on the login form. Uses Supabase's
  built-in reset-email flow; clicking the emailed link brings the person
  back to the site and shows a "set new password" form automatically.
- **Terms acceptance at signup** — a required checkbox linking to the
  Legal page. Signup is blocked until it's checked — this is the piece
  that was missing for the Terms of Service to mean anything.
- **Favicon** — a small inline one, so the browser tab doesn't look
  unfinished. Replace with a real logo file whenever you have one.

No schema changes, no new secrets — just `index.html`.

## ⭐ Consolidated deployment order (run this once, in this order)

Across 14 phases this has piled up into a lot of files. Here's the actual
order to run everything from scratch on a fresh Supabase project — skip
any step you've already done:

**SQL (Supabase → SQL Editor, run each file's contents in order):**
1. `supabase/schema.sql`
2. `supabase/schema_phase2.sql`
3. `supabase/schema_phase3.sql`
4. `supabase/schema_phase4.sql` (seeds ~1,000 demo accounts — takes a
   minute or two)
5. `supabase/schema_phase6.sql`
6. `supabase/schema_phase7.sql`
7. `supabase/schema_phase9.sql`
8. `supabase/schema_phase10.sql`
9. `supabase/schema_phase11.sql`
10. `supabase/schema_phase12.sql`
11. Bootstrap your admin account:
    ```sql
    update public.profiles set is_admin = true where username = 'yourusername';
    ```

**Edge Functions (Supabase → Edge Functions → Deploy via Editor, paste
each file's code, name it exactly as shown):**
1. `youtube-search`
2. `create-razorpay-order`
3. `verify-razorpay-payment`
4. `ai-assist`

**Secrets (Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets) — only needed for the
functions you actually want working:**
- `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` — for YouTube tab
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` + `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` — for real ad payments
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for the AI ✨ Improve button
- (`SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are provided automatically —
  never set these yourself)

**Frontend config (edit near the top of `index.html`):**
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — required, the site won't work
  without these
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` / `CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` — only needed for
  image posts; everything else works without it

**Then:** push `index.html` to your GitHub repo, confirm GitHub Pages is
serving it, and do one signup → post → like → comment → follow →
message → community → poll pass to confirm the live site behaves the
way it did in testing.

Every one of `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/`SECRET`, and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is optional — the site degrades gracefully (a plain
"not available right now" message) for any one you skip. Nothing else
depends on them.

## Phase 15 — from the NEXA audit, fastest-value items first

Run `supabase/schema_phase13.sql` after the others (adds one column).
Only `index.html` changed besides that.

Priority was: fix the one real security gap first, then the items from
the audit buildable in minutes rather than days.

1. **XSS hardening on user-supplied URLs** (security, done first) — image/
   video/link posts, and the sponsored ad card, now validate every URL is
   http(s) before rendering it and escape it properly for the attribute
   it's placed in. Previously a crafted URL in a video or link post could
   have broken out of the `src`/`href` attribute; that gap is closed. Also
   applied at the point of entry — pasting a non-http(s) URL into the
   video/link composer buttons is now rejected immediately.
2. **"Why am I seeing this?"** on the Home feed — a button next to
   Latest/Trending that explains the ranking honestly: chronological for
   Latest, like-count for Trending. **No false claims of personalization**
   — the feed doesn't actually personalize yet, so the explanation says
   that plainly rather than inventing signals that aren't real.
3. **Social Value Score** — an illustrative 0–100 score in Studio →
   Overview, computed from real followers/posts/engagement. Explicitly
   labeled as not an earnings figure, per the audit's own requirement
   ("never presented as a guaranteed earning amount").
4. **Social Passport (external links)** — Studio → Overview now has
   YouTube/Instagram/X/Other link fields, validated and saved to your
   profile. **Honest scope**: these are plain links you type in, not
   OAuth-verified connections — there's no "✓ YouTube" badge because that
   would require registering a real OAuth app per platform (a Meta/Google
   developer app + review process, similar to the Razorpay/YouTube setup
   you've already done). Displaying them on a *public* profile-viewing
   page is also not wired up yet, since Vartex doesn't have a separate
   "view someone else's profile" page — only your own Profile/Studio.

## Deliberately not started this round (bigger, lower ratio of value to time)
- **Group chat** — the current E2EE design is 1-to-1 (one AES key wrapped
  for exactly two people). Group chat needs the AES key wrapped for every
  member and rewrapped whenever membership changes — a real redesign, not
  an extension.
- **Business Mode** — a whole parallel profile type (business listings,
  offers, local campaigns) — a multi-phase feature on its own.
- **Full multi-language architecture** (Gujarati/Bengali/Tamil/etc.) —
  the current EN/MR/HI setup would need to become a proper translation-key
  system before adding more languages cheaply; right now each language is
  a hand-written object.
- **Splitting `index.html` into modules** — the file has grown large
  across 15 phases. It still works fine as one file for a GitHub
  Pages-style static site, but a real modular rewrite (separate JS files,
  a build step) is worth doing before the codebase grows much further —
  it's an architecture change, not a feature, so it wasn't the fastest
  win for a launch-focused pass.

## Phase 16 — the rest of the "what's left" list, fastest-value first

Run `supabase/schema_phase14.sql` after the others. New static files
`manifest.json` and `sw.js` go in the repo root, right next to
`index.html` (same folder — GitHub Pages serves them automatically).

1. **@mentions** — typing `@someone's-username` in a post or comment now
   notifies them (only if that username actually exists — no notification
   spam for typos).
2. **Article & Question post types** — a "Type" dropdown next to "Post to"
   in the composer. Plain posts, questions, and article-style posts share
   the same content field but get a small label on the card.
3. **Share button** — every post now has ↗ Share: uses the native share
   sheet on mobile, falls back to copying the text + a link on desktop.
4. **AI Translate** — 🌐 next to ✨ Improve in the composer, translates
   your draft into whichever of EN/MR/HI you currently have selected.
   Same `ai-assist` function and same honest limitation as Improve (needs
   your Anthropic key).
5. **Draft autosave** — your unfinished post is saved to this browser as
   you type and offered back ("Draft restored") next time you open Home.
   Clears itself once you actually post.
6. **Following-only feed** — a third filter next to Latest/Trending. Empty
   states are honest ("you're not following anyone yet") rather than
   silently showing nothing.
7. **Demo content blended into the real feed** — 1–2 demo posts (still
   clearly marked "AI DEMO") now appear among real posts on Home, not just
   on the logged-out landing page, so a fresh account doesn't feel empty —
   per the original spec's "every major feature should contain
   demonstration data."
8. **Community rules** — an optional rules field when creating a
   community, shown at the top of that community's page.
9. **Search now includes communities**, alongside people and posts.
   YouTube search stays a separate tab on purpose — folding it into every
   keystroke here would burn API quota fast (see spec's own API-cost-
   control concern); the search results page links over to it instead.
10. **Profile photos** — real image upload (via the same Cloudinary setup
    as post images) replacing the initials-only avatar, shown on your
    Profile and on every post you make.
11. **Desktop left-hand navigation** — at very wide screens (≥1400px) a
    persistent left sidebar with icon+label links to every tab appears,
    alongside the existing top tab bar and the right rail — closer to a
    "real" desktop app layout instead of a stretched mobile one.
12. **Basic PWA support** — `manifest.json` (installable "Add to Home
    Screen") and a minimal service worker that caches just the app shell
    so it opens (read-only) when offline. It does **not** cache API calls
    — Supabase/YouTube/Razorpay data always needs a live connection, this
    only means the UI itself isn't a blank white screen without one.

## Still open (from the original master-prompt gap list)
Channel view-count tracking (the column exists but nothing increments it —
there's no public "view someone's profile" page yet to attach a view event
to), dedicated Advertising Policy / Creator Monetization Terms / Referral
Terms pages (currently folded into the general Legal page), and the four
bigger items above (group chat, Business Mode, full i18n, modular file
structure).

## Phase 17 — closing out the rest of that list

Run `supabase/schema_phase15.sql` after the others. Only `index.html`
changed besides that (no new static files this round).

1. **Public profile pages** — clicking anyone's name/avatar (in the feed,
   search, or the suggested-creators rail) now opens a real profile page:
   bio, stats, social links, their posts, and Follow/Message/Report/Block
   actions. This is also what makes the next item possible.
2. **Channel views now actually increment** — every time someone opens a
   public profile page, a small server-side function (`increment_profile_view`)
   bumps that count by exactly one. It can't do anything else to the row —
   it's not a general-purpose write, just a counter.
3. **Advertising Policy / Creator Monetization Terms / Referral Terms** —
   three new sections on the Legal page, distinct from the general Terms
   of Service, per the original spec's list of required policy pages.
4. **Business Mode** — a checkbox on your Profile tab ("This is a business
   account") unlocks a business category/description and a simple listings
   manager (products/services/offers, with an optional price). Listings
   show up on your public profile page. Deliberately modular per spec §20
   — a normal creator profile is completely unaffected if you never check
   the box.
5. **Group chat (E2EE, v1)** — "+ New group" in the Messages tab. **Honest
   scope, stated plainly to you the way it's stated in the schema
   comments**: membership is fixed at creation — you list everyone by
   username when you make the group, and there's no "add someone later."
   A real add-later flow needs an existing member's browser to be online
   to re-encrypt the group key for the new person, which is a genuinely
   bigger feature. This version is still real E2EE (one AES key per group,
   wrapped individually for each member, server never sees plaintext or a
   usable key) — just with that one deliberate limitation.
6. **Broader (not complete) translation coverage** — more tab headings
   across Earn, Explore, and Studio are now translated in EN/MR/HI.

## Deliberately still not attempted: splitting `index.html` into modules
This is the one item from the list I did not touch, and I want to be
direct about why rather than attempt it and risk your live site: the file
is large now, and a real modular split (separate `js/` files, matching the
original spec's suggested structure) touches almost every function's
scope and load order at once. I have no way to actually run the app and
click through it before handing you the result — I can only read the text
back to check it's internally consistent, not that it behaves correctly in
a browser. For a page you're actively running with real users, that's a
bad trade: a subtle break (a variable no longer in scope, a script loaded
in the wrong order) could take the whole site down, and you'd be the one
discovering it. This is genuinely worth doing eventually — just as a
deliberate, tested piece of work on its own, ideally with a way to verify
it in a browser before it replaces what's live, not as one more item
batched in with everything else.

## Phase 18 — clearing the last of the pending list

Real video uploads, a dedicated Studio Analytics tab, and Brand
Opportunities. Only `index.html` changed — no new SQL.

1. **Real video file uploads** — 🎥 in the composer uploads a video file
   directly (via the same Cloudinary setup as images, using its video
   endpoint), not just a pasted URL. Capped at 100MB with a clear message
   if you go over — Cloudinary's free tier has real limits, and large
   video hosting is genuinely a cost/infra decision worth making
   deliberately later, not something to silently allow. The URL-paste
   option (for YouTube links etc.) is still there too, now labeled
   "🎬 URL" to distinguish it.
2. **Studio → Analytics** is now its own tab instead of linking out to
   Earn — the 14-day engagement chart lives where the spec's Creator
   Studio structure actually put it.
3. **Studio → Brand Opportunities** — a real (if simple) list of active
   ad campaigns any creator can browse and reach out about. It's
   deliberately just a browsable list, not an automated matching or
   negotiation system — that's a substantially bigger feature or a
   business decision better made once there are actual advertisers using
   the demo marketplace.

## On "multiple agents working in parallel"
Worth being direct about: this is one assistant working through the list
sequentially, as fast as reasonably possible — not several instances
running at once. Framing it as multi-agent wouldn't make the work happen
faster; it would just be a wrong description of how it actually got done.

## ⚠️ Phase 19 — a real security bug found on self-review, fixed

You asked me to proactively find what's worth doing without waiting to be
told. Re-reading the RLS policies against the master prompt's own rule
("never trust frontend values for earnings, roles, admin privileges,
verification — server-validated only") turned up a genuine gap, not a
style nitpick:

**The bug**: `"users update own profile"` (from Phase 1) checks *which
row* someone can update, but Postgres RLS doesn't restrict *which
columns* in that row. Any signed-in user could open the browser console
and run:
```js
supabase.from('profiles').update({ is_admin: true }).eq('id', myOwnId)
```
— and it would have succeeded. Same gap let a suspended user un-suspend
themselves, let anyone directly inflate their own follower/post counts
(which feed the Social Value Score and creator-payout eligibility), and
let an advertiser set their own campaign's `budget_inr` without an actual
Razorpay payment ever clearing.

**The fix** (`supabase/schema_phase16.sql`, run after everything else):
`BEFORE UPDATE` triggers on `profiles`, `ad_campaigns`, and `communities`
that silently revert the sensitive columns (`is_admin`, `status`, the
follower/post/view counters, `referral_code`, `username` on profiles;
`budget_inr` on campaigns; `members_count`/`status` on communities) to
their existing value unless the request comes from an admin or from one
of Vartex's own legitimate trigger functions (liking, following, joining,
a verified Razorpay payment). Those legitimate paths still work exactly
as before — this only closes the direct-write bypass.

**Scope, stated plainly**: `posts.likes_count`/`comments_count` have the
same theoretical gap (a user could inflate their own post's like count
via a direct API call) but I left those unguarded this round — the impact
is cosmetic (trending manipulation, not money or access), and guarding
them needs the same session-flag plumbing added to four more trigger
functions. Worth doing, just correctly scoped as a smaller follow-up
rather than bundled in when the higher-stakes fixes needed shipping now.

**Action needed from you**: run `schema_phase16.sql` as soon as you can —
this is the one file in this whole project I'd call urgent rather than
routine.

## Phase 20 — continuing the same self-audit

Two more of the same bug class, found by re-checking every UPDATE policy
against "what column is this actually allowed to touch," not just "whose
row is this." Run `supabase/schema_phase17.sql` after Phase 16 (it needs
`is_system_write()` from that file).

1. **Posts: un-removing your own moderated content.** Same root cause as
   Phase 16, lower stakes — closing it now for completeness rather than
   leaving it open. A post's author could directly set `likes_count`/
   `comments_count` via a raw API call (trending manipulation, not
   dangerous), but more importantly could set their own `status` straight
   back to `'ACTIVE'` after an admin removed it or the auto-moderation
   trigger flagged it — silently undoing moderation entirely. All three
   columns are now locked to admin-or-system-only, same pattern as before.
2. **Messages: a recipient could rewrite message history.** This one's
   worth explaining because it's subtler. The "mark as read" policy for
   1-to-1 messages checked *who* could update a message row, not *which
   column* — and a recipient already holds the AES key needed to decrypt
   their messages, so they're also fully capable of encrypting a
   *replacement* ciphertext and overwriting the original with it. That
   means a recipient could have rewritten what a sender appears to have
   said, after the fact — a real integrity problem for anything screenshot
   or referenced later, even though the content stays end-to-end
   encrypted throughout. Fixed by locking every column except `read_at`
   on that table, with no admin exception this time — nobody, including
   an admin, should be able to alter the content of an encrypted message,
   since that would undercut the whole point of it being end-to-end
   encrypted in the first place.

Both were caught by asking the same question Phase 16 was already asking,
just applied to the rest of the schema rather than stopping after the
first three tables.

## 🚨 Phase 21 — a critical FUNCTIONAL bug, not just security

This one is more important than Phases 19-20. Re-checking every trigger
function against "does this actually have permission to write the row
it's touching" turned up something that's been silently broken since
Phase 2 — before any of the security-guard phases even existed.

**The bug**: every counter-maintaining trigger in this project — the ones
behind `likes_count`, `comments_count`, follower counts, community
`members_count`, poll `votes_count`, and ad `impressions_count`/
`clicks_count` — was written as a plain function, which in Postgres
defaults to running with the *calling user's own* database permissions,
not elevated ones. So when User B likes User A's post, the trigger tries
to update User A's post — but the posts table's update rule only allows
someone to update *their own* post. User B isn't the author, so that
write was silently rejected (zero rows changed, no error shown anywhere)
every single time the action came from someone other than the row's
owner. Poll votes were worse: that table never had *any* update permission
for anyone, so vote counts have never incremented for any voter, ever.

**Net effect**: likes/comments/follows/community-joins/poll-votes/ad-
impressions from anyone other than the content's own owner have likely
been recorded (the underlying `likes`/`follows`/`poll_votes`/etc. rows
save fine) but the visible *counts* next to them never actually moved.
Self-likes on your own post would have worked, which is exactly the kind
of thing that could go unnoticed in solo testing.

**The fix** (`supabase/schema_phase18.sql`, run after Phase 17): every
one of those trigger functions is redefined the same correct way
`notify_on_follow`/`handle_new_user`/etc. were already written elsewhere
in this project — with elevated permissions scoped narrowly to just that
function, the same pattern, just finally applied consistently everywhere
it needed to be. The file also **backfills every existing count** from
the real underlying rows (actual like rows, actual follow rows, etc.), so
whatever's already in your database gets corrected, not just future
activity.

**Action needed from you**: run this one before you do any serious
testing of like/follow/comment counts — what you may have seen so far for
any interaction that wasn't with your own content was very possibly
showing a stale number.

## Phase 22 — closing the loop on the same pattern

One more of the Phase 16/17 class, found while re-checking every UPDATE
policy a final time: `supabase/schema_phase19.sql` (run after Phase 18)
locks `notifications` the same way messages were locked — a user could
previously rewrite their own notification's `actor_id`/`type`/`post_id`
to say anything, via the same "checks the row, not the column" gap. Real-
world impact is low here (it's only ever visible to that one person), but
it's the same class of thing, so it's closed for consistency rather than
left as the one exception.

At this point I've gone through every UPDATE policy in the project asking
the same question twice (once for the column-guard class of bug, once for
the missing-SECURITY-DEFINER class of bug) and haven't found more of
either. I'll keep looking if you say continue, but wanted to flag this as
a natural checkpoint — Phase 18 in particular is worth confirming actually
works (test a like/follow from a second account and check the count) before
piling on more schema changes on top of it.

## Phase 23 — real PWA icons (fixes the generic Chrome icon)

You noticed the installed app showed a generic Chrome icon instead of a
real logo. Cause: the manifest was pointing at an inline SVG data URI,
and Chrome's install criteria don't reliably accept that — it needs real
PNG files at standard sizes to treat the site as a "real" installable app
with its own icon, otherwise it falls back to a plain bookmark shortcut
with the browser's own icon overlaid.

New: an `icons/` folder with four real PNG files (192px and 512px, each
in a plain version and a "maskable" version — the maskable ones have
extra padding so Android's adaptive-icon shapes, like a circle or squircle
mask, don't crop into the logo). `manifest.json` now points at these
instead of the inline SVG, `index.html` has an `apple-touch-icon` link
(iOS Safari never reads the manifest for icons — it only ever looks for
that tag), and `sw.js` caches the new icon files too (cache name bumped so
old cached versions clear out automatically).

**Action needed from you**: push the whole `icons/` folder alongside the
updated `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, and `index.html`. Then, on the device
where you already installed it once, **remove the old install first**
(long-press the icon → uninstall/remove) before reinstalling — browsers
cache manifest data aggressively per-origin, so the old broken icon can
stick around even after the files are fixed, unless you remove and
reinstall fresh.

## Phase 24 — the last of the original master-prompt gaps, plus a logo redo

Run `supabase/schema_phase20.sql` after phase 19. Deploy the new
`send-notification-email` Edge Function the same way as the others (only
if you want email notifications — see below, it's optional). Only
`index.html` changed otherwise, plus the redesigned `icons/` files.

1. **Followers/Following lists** — the follower/following counts on your
   Profile tab and on any public profile page are now tappable and open an
   actual list of people, not just a number.
2. **Community moderator UI** — a community's admin can open "Members" on
   that community's page and promote someone to moderator (or remove that
   role) directly — the `community_members.role` column existed since
   Phase 3 but had no way to actually change it until now.
3. **"Who viewed my profile"** — a real list (Profile tab → "Who viewed my
   profile"), not just a count. Signed-out viewers show as "Someone" rather
   than being silently uncounted or wrongly attributed.
4. **Verified badges** — a ✔ next to a name wherever it appears (posts,
   profiles, search). Admin tab has a simple search-and-toggle to grant or
   remove it — there's no self-serve "apply for verification" flow, which
   matches how this actually works on real platforms (admin-granted, not
   automatic).
5. **Image compression before upload** — every image (post photos, profile
   photos) is now resized and re-encoded client-side (max 1600px, JPEG
   ~82% quality) before it's sent to Cloudinary, so uploads are faster and
   use less of your free-tier quota. **Honest scope on video**: real
   client-side video compression needs a heavy library (ffmpeg.wasm,
   several MB to download) that isn't a good trade-off for most posts, so
   video uploads still rely on the existing 100MB cap plus Cloudinary's
   own automatic delivery-time optimization instead.
6. **Email notifications** — new `send-notification-email` function using
   Resend (resend.com, generous free tier). **This one needs real setup
   from you**, in three parts:
   - Sign up at resend.com, verify a sending domain (or use their shared
     test domain to start), get an API key
   - Deploy the function, set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM` secrets
   - **Wire the trigger** — unlike the other functions, this one doesn't
     fire on its own. In the Supabase dashboard: Database → Webhooks →
     Create a new webhook → table `notifications`, event `INSERT`, type
     "Supabase Edge Function", target this function. That connection is a
     dashboard setting, not something a `.sql` file can express, which is
     why it's called out here explicitly.
   - Users can opt out anytime via the checkbox on their Profile tab
     (`email_notifications`, on by default) — the function checks this
     before sending.

## Logo — redesigned to a single-color mark

The old app icon mixed two unrelated colors (a dark background plus an
orange dot) with no connection to the name. Replaced with a bold single-
color "V" — one color for the whole mark (marigold), geometric, and
directly tied to the name (Vartex). Used consistently now in `icons/`,
the favicon, and the small mark next to the wordmark in the header.

## Phase 25 — two real fixes from user feedback

Only `index.html` and `sw.js` changed. No SQL.

1. **Removed the technical key-setup prompt.** You were right — no
   consumer app asks someone to "paste your backed-up private key JSON."
   A new device now silently generates its own messaging key, exactly
   like opening WhatsApp fresh on a new phone. The trade-off is the same
   as before (old messages aren't readable on a device that never had the
   original key) — that limitation still exists, it's just never shown to
   the person as a decision they have to make.
2. **PWA auto-update, actually fixed.** Service worker registration now
   uses `updateViaCache: 'none'` (stops the browser's own HTTP cache from
   hiding a changed `sw.js` for up to 24h), listens for a new version
   taking over and reloads the page once automatically, and re-checks for
   updates whenever the installed app is brought back to the foreground.
   Push a new `index.html` from now on and people using the installed app
   should get it within moments of reopening it — no more manual
   cache-clearing needed for ordinary content updates (that was only ever
   necessary for the one-time icon fix).

## Phase 26 — the real fix: messages now follow the account, not the device

This replaces the Phase 25 "silently generate a new key" behavior with
something that actually solves what you asked for: log in as the same
person on any phone, laptop, or browser, and your messages are readable
there — not just going forward, but your existing ones too, as long as
the device that receives them has been unlocked with your passphrase at
least once. Run `supabase/schema_phase21.sql` after phase 20. Only
`index.html` changed besides that.

**How it actually works**, in plain terms: the very first time you ever
open Messages, you choose a passphrase (separate from your login
password — only ever typed into your browser, never sent anywhere in
readable form). Your messaging key gets locked with that passphrase and
the locked (still-unreadable-without-it) version is saved to your
account. Any other device, the first time it needs your key, asks for
that same passphrase, unlocks the key locally in the browser, and from
then on that device just works silently too — same as the first one.

**Why this is genuinely still end-to-end encrypted, not a workaround**:
the server only ever stores your key in its locked form. Nobody — not an
admin, not a database breach, not me — can open it without your
passphrase, because the passphrase itself never leaves your browser (the
unlocking happens on your device, using standard PBKDF2 + AES-GCM, the
same category of technique Signal and iCloud Keychain use for exactly
this problem).

**The one honest trade-off, same as before, just now a deliberate choice
instead of an invisible default**: if you forget that passphrase, there
truly is no way to recover older messages — not because of a limitation
I could patch, but because a recoverable-without-the-passphrase backup
would mean the server *could* read your messages, which defeats the
entire point. "I forgot it — start fresh" is offered as an explicit,
honest way out when that happens, same as Signal's own PIN-reset flow.

**What this does NOT yet cover**: anyone who already generated a key
under the old, un-backed-up system (including your own test account from
the last few days) has no backup on file — the next time messaging is
opened on any device without a local key, it'll go through the "set up
your message passphrase" flow as if for the first time, same as a brand
new account. That's expected, not a bug — there was nothing to back up
before now.

## Phase 27 — messages simplified, per explicit request: no more passphrase

Removes Phase 21's passphrase system entirely. Messages now work exactly
like you asked — log in anywhere, see your messages immediately, no
extra step, ever. Run `supabase/schema_phase22.sql` after phase 21. Only
`index.html` changed besides that.

**What changed under the hood**: messages are no longer encrypted in the
browser before being sent. They're stored as regular text, protected the
same way as everything else private in this app — Row Level Security
that only lets the sender and recipient ever retrieve a given message.
Group chat works the same way now too, and creating a group no longer
requires anyone to "have set up messaging" first, since there's no key to
set up anymore.

**The Privacy Center has been rewritten to match reality** — it now
plainly states messages are not end-to-end encrypted, explains what
*does* protect them (access control, not encryption) and who could
technically still read them (someone with direct database access). This
was important to get right rather than leave outdated claims sitting
there.

**Why this was the right call once you'd made the trade-off explicit**:
you're right that WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook's everyday chats don't ask
for a passphrase, and the reason is exactly what Phase 26 explained then
— they don't offer that same "we truly cannot read this" guarantee on
regular chats either (WhatsApp's default chats *are* E2E, but linking a
new device still involves a QR-scan step for exactly this reason; standard
Instagram/Messenger chats generally aren't E2E at all). There's no version
of this that has zero friction ever AND is genuinely unreadable by the
server — you can only pick one. You picked "works everywhere, no
friction," which is a completely reasonable product decision — it just
needed to be paired with telling people the truth about what is and isn't
encrypted, which the Privacy Center now does.

**Old messages from Phase 21's E2E system** show as a plain note
("an older message from before this chat was upgraded") rather than the
technical "[Could not decrypt]" text, since they genuinely can't be
recovered (their content only ever existed in encrypted form, and that
encryption is exactly what's being removed) — this is expected for your
existing test conversations, not a bug.
